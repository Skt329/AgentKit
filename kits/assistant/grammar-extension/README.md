## 🔑 Setup

### Required Keys and Config

You'll need two things to run this extension:

1. **lamatic-config.json payload** → copy it from your Lamatic Studio project (this defines your grammar check workflow).  
   ⚠️ Note: The `lamatic-config.json` in this repo is just a **dummy example**.  
   Replace it with your own exported config from Lamatic Studio.

| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Lamatic Config          | Defines your grammar check workflow          | From your Lamatic Studio Agent Kit Project      |

### 1. Config File

Copy your project payload into `lamatic-config.json` in the extension root directory (you can start from [`lamatic-config-example.json`](./lamatic-config-example.json)).

### 2. Load Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the extension directory containing `manifest.json`
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list
